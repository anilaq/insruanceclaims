# insruanceclaims

Executive Summary 

The project that I have undertaken exposes the various ways that fraud can be detected within the insurance claims industry. Fraudulent claims are not only made by claimants but also medical providers. For this reason I have taken it upon myself to figure out how to best detect fraud. 

I will be doing this by grouping providers and beneficiaries by similarities. I will then use machine learning algorithms to detect fraud and measure the accuracy. I will reduce overfitting and pick the best winning model followed by doing some threshold selection and cost function analysis.
